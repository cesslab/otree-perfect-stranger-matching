## oTree Perfect Stranger Matching Example

The puropose of this project is to illustrate a possible implementation for perfect stranger matching, or round robin matching.

If you are looking to implement perfect stranger matching, the key file to look at is the models.py file. In particular the creating_session function in the Subsession class.

You can also play through the example game to see a table containing all the pairings across all rounds. Each player will have their group in the current round highlighted in the table.
